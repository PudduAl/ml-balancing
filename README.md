# Game prototype to test ML-based level balancing 

This prototype consists of a small survival game, in which two players, one human and one computer controlled, are required to collected necessary resources, such as water and food in order to survive. The game contains 8 levels (preset), which were created and balanced using reinforcement learning. It also features a fully functional level editor, which allows players to create custom levels and share them with others.

TODO: Additional description

#### Features
- 8 Preset levels, which were created using reinforcement learning and used as part of a user study
- Level editor to create and share self-made levels



This game prototype was originally developed as part of my bachelor's thesis for the study course Computer Science and Media (german: Medieninformatik) at Stuttgart Media University. It was also developed in parallel for a scientific work, in which human players were asked to fill out a survey about the percieved balance/fairness of the generated (preset) levels.

Further information and the results of the scientific work can be read in the paper '**It might be balanced, but is it actually good? An Empirical Evaluation of Game Level Balancing**' ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11396))
