# Game prototype to test ML-based level balancing 

This prototype consists of a small survival game, in which two players, one human and one computer controlled, are required to collected necessary resources, such as water and food in order to survive. The game contains 8 levels (preset), which were created and balanced using reinforcement learning. It also features a fully functional level editor, which allows players to create custom levels and share them with others.
