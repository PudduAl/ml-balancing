    <h1>About the 'ML-balancing' prototype</h1>
    This game prototype was developed as part of a scientific study to determine whether video game levels generated and balanced using reinforcement learning would be perceived as fair/balanced by human players. The generated levels (called 'preset' in the main menu) were playtested by human players along with a short survey they had to fill out. The survey contained questions about certain properties of the levels, such as the amount and distribution of resources placed during the generation process.
